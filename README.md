### Hi there, I am Shankar 👋

I work as a Technical Trainer @aws. Formerly a php and vue enthusiast. Currently focusing on DS and ML. Personality trait: INFJ-A. 

I create interactive web stuff using Laravel, AWS CDK / CloudFormation, Vue js, and Nuxt js. I love writing ✏️ articles about what I learn and share with open source community. You can find my other php and laravel pacakges on my other github orgs. namely [iwouldrathercode](https://github.com/iwouldrathercode), which is the main github org where you can find most of my public repositories.
